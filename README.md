# 🛡️ Smart Anti-Scam
### Web-Based SMS Scam Detection Using Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Anti-Scam is a web-based machine learning application designed to detect and classify SMS messages as scam or legitimate. The system analyzes user-provided text in real time using natural language processing techniques and a trained machine learning model.

The application follows a full-stack web architecture, consisting of:
- A Flask backend API for prediction and inference
- A machine learning model trained on labeled SMS data
- A lightweight web interface for user interaction

This project is intended for academic and practical demonstration purposes in applied machine learning and scam prevention.
